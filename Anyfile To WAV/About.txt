This is a small test program I made to learn about file pointers and processing data in sections rather than read entire files into memory and then write to an output file.

While the practicality of the file may only suit a select few people, it's none-the-less an interesting concept and I've enjoyed using it to find raw audio hidden in
video game files.  I do realize other programs are capable of doing this very thing with more configurability, I am interested in learning the language and how commands
and functions work/interact with eachother.

I've been learning C# for less than a month, so this program is actually a HUGE feat for me.  (go easy on me :) 
Any feedback is welcome.  If you know any tricks to shorten the code, I'd be interested in learning.  This is still a work-in-progress and I intend to add more
functionality (support for files larger than 4gb, select destination folder (currently saves to desktop) and maybe make it a little prettier.)
